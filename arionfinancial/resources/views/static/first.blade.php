                                    <p><b>(CL News)</b> - Amanda Haughman, a student at Cambridge University, was able to drop 2 stone off her waist in 1 month without ever using a dime of her own money. Amanda is studying nutrition sciences at Cambridge,
                                        and for a required research project Amanda thought it would be perfect to use university funds to find out how to 'hack' her weight loss. According to Amanda, "the most expensive piece of it all was actually finding
                                        what worked. But the actual solution only cost about £3."</p>

                                    <p><i>"I had struggled with my weight my whole life. I tried things like Weight Watchers and Jenny Craig, which just didn't work as good as they promised. I am a single Mom with a kid at home and I am also working towards my degree, so I don't have any time to be at the gym. When I was assigned this big research project, I saw it as a perfect opportunity to get a deeper look at the natural weight loss opportunities that are out there, and that is when I found out about combining <a href="http://wiqfc.trackvoluum.com/click/">Wild Raspberry Ketone</a> and apple cider vinegar. The best part of it all, I can tell that my daughter is proud of me." - Amanda Haughman</i></p>

                                    <p>Since the study, Amanda shared the Wild Raspberry Ketone and apple cider vinegar combination with her close friend, Mark, who had also been struggling with his weight. Mark's results are even more impressive than Amanda.</p>

                                    <div class="results" style="background: #EEE; border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: center;"><img height="342" src="{{ asset('public/static_assets') }}/mark-weight-loss.jpg" width="608">
                                        <p style="text-align: center;padding:6px;"><em><strong>Mark lost over 9 stone in under 12 months with Amanda's help</strong></em></p>

                                    &nbsp;

                                    <p>We sat down with Amanda to ask her more about how she found out about Wild Raspberry Ketone and whether or not that is all that she used to lose 2 stone so quickly.</p>

                                    <p><strong>CL News:</strong> Tell us, how did you know where to start?</p>

                                    <p><i><strong>Amanda:</strong> To be honest, I really didn't. I was given a budget for the project by the university, and I spent nearly all of it researching everything under the sun. I looked into other previous research, case studies, and even successful weight loss stories of others.</i></p>

                                    <p><strong>CL News:</strong> So, how did you find out about Wild Raspberry Ketone and apple cider vinegar?</p>

                                    <p><i><strong>Amanda:</strong> It's sort of funny, while I was looking into weight loss stories of others I decided to see if I could find out more about how celebrities were able to lose so much weight so quickly. Surprisingly, even with all of the tabloids, it was pretty challenging to find concrete information on exactly how they did it. However, I was able to find a radio interview where some actresses credited their entire weight loss to combining <a href="http://wiqfc.trackvoluum.com/click/">Wild Raspberry Ketone</a> with apple cider vinegar.</i></p>

                                    <p><strong>CL News:</strong> Was it expensive to get Wild Raspberry Ketone?</p>

                                    <p><i><strong>Amanda:</strong> It actually was not very expensive at all, and thankfully so. By the time I had found out about Wild Raspberry Ketone and apple cider vinegar, I had about £15 left in my project budget. Since Wild Raspberry Ketone is a completely natural formula, the supplier doesn't spend a lot to manufacture it. Additionally, they actually provided me with a <a href="http://wiqfc.trackvoluum.com/click/">free 1 month sample</a> and I just paid for shipping! So I got Wild Raspberry Ketone for £2.95 and picked up a bottle of apple cider vinegar for £2 from a local grocery store, and I still had £10 left in my budget!</i></p>

                                    <p><strong>CL News:</strong> That's impressive! Could you explain how it works?</p>

                                    <p><i><strong>Amanda:</strong> There isn't much to it, and that is the appeal of it all. Every morning, I made tea with 1 - 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar and took Wild Raspberry Ketone with it. Other than that, I didn't change a single thing in my daily routine. 30 days later, I am 2 stone off the waist and in better shape than ever before!</i></p>

                                    <p><strong>Why is Wild Raspberry Ketone so effective?</strong></p>

                                    <p>Wild Raspberry Ketone contains the naturally occurring ingredient, hydroxycitcric acid, which boosts weight loss by blocking excess body fat production while increasing resting metabolism by more than 130%. This combination
                                        makes the body go from a fat-gain to fat-loss state while resting.</p>

                                        <p class="bold">Week One:</p>

                                        <p>One week after combining Wild Raspberry Ketone with apple cider vinegar every morning I was surprised at the dramatic results. My energy level was up, and I wasn't even hungry. A welcomed side effect of <a href="http://wiqfc.trackvoluum.com/click/">Wild Raspberry Ketone</a>                                            is its power to curb the appetite.</p>

                                        <p>Best of all, I didn't even change anything about my daily routine. On Day 7, I got on the scale and couldn't believe my eyes. I had lost 0.6 stone. But I still wasn't convinced, since they say you lose a lot of
                                            water weight at the beginning of any diet. I wanted to wait and see the results in the upcoming weeks.</p>

                                        <p class="bold">Week Three:</p>

                                        <p>After 3 weeks, all my doubts and skepticism had absolutely vanished! I am down 2 pant sizes after losing another 1 stone. And I still have a ton of energy. Quite often, around the third week of other diets, I would
                                            tend to run out of steam. But with <a href="http://wiqfc.trackvoluum.com/click/">Wild Raspberry Ketone</a> my energy levels didn't dip, instead they remain steady throughout the day.</p>

                                        <p class="bold">Week Four:</p>

                                        <p>After the fourth week, my final results were shocking. I lost an unbelievable 2 stone since starting with apple cider vinegar and<a href="http://wiqfc.trackvoluum.com/click/"> Wild Raspberry Ketone</a>! I feel blessed
                                            to share this with other people who are struggling with their weight as well. Using Wild Raspberry Ketone in week 4, I lost an additional 0.4 stone.</p>
